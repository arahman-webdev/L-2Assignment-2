# 1. What is PostgreSQL?

 PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that is widely used for enterprise-level performance and reliability.

 It's known for its robust features, flexibility, and standards compliance. PostgreSQL supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying, making it suitable for a wide range of applications

 # 2. What is the purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL?

 In PostgreSQL, a schema is like a folder inside a database. It helps keep related things (like tables, views, and functions) organized. This makes it easier to manage the database and control who can access what. Schemas also stop different objects from having the same name and help different users.

 # 3. What is the difference between the VARCHAR and CHAR data types?

 Key Differences Between CHAR and VARCHAR:

 Difference of Char:

 1. Has a fixed length.

 2. Always takes up the same amount of space.

 3. text is even shorter, it fills the extra space with blank spaces. 

Difference of VARCHAR:

1. Has a variable length.

2. Uses only as much space as needed.

3. No extra spaces are added.

# 4. What are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses used for?

LIMIT and OFFSET can be used to paginate results, improving usability and performance.

More Explaination of LIMIT
1. Tells the database how many rows to show.
2. Useful for showing just a part of the data (like the first 5 rows).

Explaination of OFFSET:
1. Tells the database to skip a certain number of rows before showing results.
2. Helps when to show the next page of data.

# 5. Explain the Primary Key and Foreign Key concepts in PostgreSQL.

1. Primiray Key: It is a special column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row. No two rows can have the same primary key value, and it cannot be empty (NULL). Think of it like a unique ID for each record.

2. Foreign Key: It is a column in one table that points to the primary key in another table. It creates a link between the two tables, helping keep data connected and consistent.
